The goal of this project is to construct a series of related reports and a dashboard from a single data source using visualizations that include scatter charts and bar charts to create reports that will provide insight about our dataset, including Life Expectancy by Year and GDP Per Capita by Year.

Description of the dataset  The Gapminder dataset SampleDataWS combines data from multiple sources into coherent time-series information about life expectancy over time for countries and regions around the world.

### Data Cleaning
Here are some cleaning and transformation tasks we want to complete:
- The Name column actually contains country names and should be renamed to Country.
- The name life_exp isn't meaningful. Rename it as Life Expectancy.
- We won't use the g77 column for our analysis. Let's remove it.

### Analysis
-	We'll look at how life expectancy evolves by year and by region. We will plot a scatter chart between “Year” and “Life” “Expectancy”. From the scatter chart, we can see that life expectancy grows over time.
-	The GDP per capita variation over time follows the same trend. The Stacked Column Chart was used to show this trend.
